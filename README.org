#+title: Scoring Engine Configuration Editor

Lovely title, provides a graphical editor for configuration files as accepted by [[http://github.com/scoringengine/scoringengine][the MACCDC scoring engine]]

Future plans include:

1. The ability to generate Terraform configuration files to make setup of entire networks that match the scoring engine configuration easier
2. When generating Terraform configuration, make it so that some services can be configured, not just the boxes, such as a Wordpress site being configured to access a specific database, filling out some of the basic configuration
